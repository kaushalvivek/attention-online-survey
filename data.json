        "If this woman isn't the luckiest person alive, then we don't know who is.",
        "A video with over five million views shows a woman miraculously surviving a train run-over. At first, it simply looks like a video of a train passing by. But as soon as the 42 bogeys disappear from the frame, a woman - who had been lying on the tracks all this while - gets up and is ushered away by other passengers on the platform.",
        "The video trended on YouTube after it was shared on February 21. While it remains unclear how the woman landed on the tracks, another woman can be heard saying that she fell while crossing them.",
        "Well, good sense came to prevail because after falling, the woman laid completely still on the tracks and let the train pass over her. And that's how she survived!",
        "Not only was she lucky but also extremely brave! Kudos to her and we hope she never lands herself in such a soup ever again."

      "paragraphs": [
        "The running joke among Indian entrepreneurs is that it's easier to get a divorce than to shut down a company. And the experience of Stayzilla co-founders Yogendra Vasupal and Sachit Singhi shows that it can get extremely messy.",
        "Closing a company in India can take years, though opening one - or many - is easy enough.",
        "When Thirukumaran Nagarajan decided to close his edtech startup Eduraft in 2013, a year after setting it up, he simply ceased operations, returned investor money, and moved on.",
        "Two years later, the auditors at his current venture NinjaCart -his third attempt, and an agri-marketing platform that's managed to raise funding - advised him to formally close Eduraft.",
        "It's been four years since he decided to take them up on that advice but he's still trying to wind up the business. \"Since we didn't have any creditors and had returned our investor money, we thought we were good to go.",
        "Later, we found out that it is not as simple as that. Regulatory compliance requires a procedure to be followed while returning money. Not shutting an earlier venture can create roadblocks for the current venture. We are now getting ready to file the winding-up petition,\" says Nagarajan.",
        "While being an entrepreneur seems exciting and fail-fast is the new refrain, India's archaic laws and labyrinthine processes of liquidation make dealing with shutting down a startup far harder than handling the emotional struggle of giving up.",

        "Eighteen people were killed and 131 injured in two deadly explosions in Dilsukhnagar, a crowded shopping area in the city, on February 21, 2013. On November 7, the final arguments had concluded in the case before the NIA special court.",
        "Since IM founder Riyaz Bhatkal, the prime accused in the case, is absconding, the trial was split up against him. The court convicted Yasin Bhatkal and others under various sections of Indian Penal Code, Arms Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).",
        "The NIA special court, after hearing the defence and prosecution's arguments, pronounced the quantum of sentence. According to NIA, Riyaz Bhatkal arranged for explosive substances and directed Asadullah Akhtar and Zia-ur-Rahman at Mangalore to receive the same.",

        "India is pursuing a \"Make in India\" campaign to attract companies such as Apple. Modi's government has taken several steps to promote foreign investment, including partial exemptions to a rule that overseas firms must source 30% of raw materials locally.",

        "The Barren Island volcano, on a remote uninhabited island off the country's eastern coast, had been lying dormant for more than 150 years until it saw a major eruption in 1991. Since then it has shown intermittent activity, including eruptions in 1995 and 2005.",
        "Over four hours of observation January 26, the scientists saw ash clouds during the daytime and fountains of red lava spewing from the volcano's mouth and streaming down its slopes after sundown, said India's National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in a statement Monday.",
        "The volcano erupted in bursts of cloud and smoke lasting about five to 10 minutes.",
        "\"It was a small eruption compared to the last major eruptions in 1991 and 1995,\" Dr. Abhay Mudholkar, chief scientist at the Goa-based NIO, told CNN.",
        "Mudholkar said their team was about one nautical mile from the island. They did not land on it as it was considered too dangerous.",
        "The team took samples of sediments and water in the vicinity of the volcano and recovered coal-like black pyroclastic material, the NIO said in a statement.",

        "As part of PM's efforts to eradicate the practice, the council has introduced mascots to direct offenders to nearest toilet",

        "The city's municipal council has announced that 28 turbaned, brightly coloured mascots will be deployed across the Lutyens Delhi area to watch for people relieving themselves around railway tracks or slum areas.",
        "If the 'Swachh Sewaks' (clean attendants) come across any offenders, they will blow a whistle and direct them to the nearest public toilet.",
        "India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, has made it a priority to eradicate the practice of public defecation by October 2019. Unicef statistics show that more than half of rural Indians still defecate in public, excreting nearly 65,000 tonnes of faeces into the environment each day.",
        "The practice, stubbornly ingrained in India's rural culture in particular, is the main factor in the country's high rate of diarrhoea-related deaths among children aged five and under. About 188,000 die each year from conditions linked to frequent bouts of diarrhoea, which weakens their immune systems and makes them more vulnerable to malnutrition and diseases such as polio or pneumonia.",
        "Public defecation also contributes to crimes against women, who, for reasons of modesty, will usually venture out to relieve themselves early in the morning or late at night, making them more vulnerable to attackers. Police in Bihar said two years ago that about 400 rape cases in the state might have been prevented if the women had had toilets in their homes.",
